linux_kvm -- the main real monitor. Secure; zero copy. Used for all published
	perf measurements.

linux_dbg -- a debugging environment that meets the pal_abi interface.
	It doesn't even pretend to isolate; a rogue binary could just bring
	along its own int 0x80s. Useful because the resulting processes are
	ordinary linux processes, to which gdb may be attached.
	It also includes a memory profiler and a sampling perf profiler.

	I wrote this monitor first to make progress on the DPI toolkit;
	the linux_kvm monitor is better factored. Rather than maintaining
	this one, it would be better to drop it, and introduce a debug-monitor
	option to the linux_kvm monitor.

linux_ptrace -- I thought about writing a ptrace-based monitor, to have one
	usable on non-kvm-enabled machines. I got as far
	as starting to figure out how to ensure it fails closed.

common -- interfaces and implementations of the Zoog UI abstractions.
	The implementations are abstract and must be supplied with concrete
	accessors to the underlying display and PAL connection. Used in both
	linux monitors; should be integrated into genode and others as well.

linux_common -- shared memory machinery and X Windows UI accessors
	common to the monitors..

genode -- a microkernel monitor based on Genode's L4::Pistachio instance.

win -- where a windows-host monitor goes. This release does not include
	a windows monitor, because the most current version is pretty far
	behind the current zoog ABI. Hopefully a future release will include
	an updated win monitor.
