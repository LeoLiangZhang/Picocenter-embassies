This module includes BlitterManager, a class that manage the dynamic
relationships among a set of zoog viewports and canvases a monitor manages.
The monitor-side interface is the BlitPalIfc (that is, how the monitor
routes communication from the blit manager to the PAL that uses it).
The implementation-side interface is the BlitProviderIfc; this is the
thing that can draw on the display (eg, X for Linux, Nitpicker for Genode,
or Win32 for Windows).
