This is the half of the host implementation that's security-sensitive.
This implementation enforces containment by relying on the
linux kvm facility, which exposes hardware processor virtualization.

The monitor uses two types of processes:
	- the coordinator provides
		the local network router,
		a connection to the tun network, and
		the faciilty to launch new applications.
	- each zoog address space (app) is hosted by one monitor process.
	  On 32-bit hosts, this is particularly necessary, since the monitor
	  maps all of the guests' memory into its own address space.
	  Hosting multiple large apps would quickly exhaust the monitor's
	  address space.
