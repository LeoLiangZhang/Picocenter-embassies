This is the untrusted half of the host implementation, the
"platform abstraction layer", or PAL. It runs inside the sandbox
container, so it can be corrupted by a malicious host application.
Thus it is not responsible to enforce any properties.
Instead, it exists to glue between the generic, standard PAL ABI
and the particular communication techinque we use to convey those
requests to the trusted monitor.
