*** instructions rotted; use scripts/create_vendor.pl instead ***

This directory contains stable key pairs. In production, of course,
one wouldn't publish key pairs as source code, but this makes development
testing easy.

I created the sample vendor keys with:

../build/crypto_util --genkeys vendor-a.keys --name vendor-a
../build/crypto_util --genkeys vendor-b.keys --name vendor-b
../build/crypto_util --genkeys zftp-zoog.keys --name zftp-zoog
	// NB _'s become -'s in vendor names, because DNS doesn't allow '_'.

I didn't automate this, because these are static, well-known
keys. If we automate, we want to also automate the creation of certs.
These keys have hand-generated certs in ../certs.
