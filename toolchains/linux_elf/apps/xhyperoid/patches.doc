Zoog patches:

The patches/ mostly fix compiler warnings, since we compile with -Wall.

patches/hyperoid neuters the sigsuspend call, since I'm too lazy to
neuter it in xax_posix_emulation's system call table. (And, of course,
what we really need to do is replace that timer delay with an instance
of a Zoog zutex timer.)

The new code implements the zoog instance of graphics.h, which paints on
a zoog canvas. I implemented it by gutting and rewiring the svga.c
implementation, so that interface is also done as a patch against svga.c.
