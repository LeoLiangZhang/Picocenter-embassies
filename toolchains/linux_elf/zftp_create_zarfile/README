This directory builds a posix application, meant to run on the app vendor's
server. Capture an app's file dependencies by running it against a
zftp_backend with the '--log-paths' option, then feed that logfile
to zftp_create_zarfile to bundle all those paths into a zarfile for
one-step bulk loading.
